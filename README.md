# Random Scripts
Test repository for some sample scripts I have written. Not all of them are finished, so if you see something that needs fixing, feel free to let me know! 

## Python Scripts
- ceasar (substitution) cipher written in python
- ARP spoofer works with a wireless connection on a local network
- The HTTP traffic sniffer will capture all HTTP traffic from a target on the LAN that you are currently running the ARP spoofing script against.
- The DNS spoofer has given me quite a bit of trouble, as I have not gotten it to fully work yet. Please let me know if I have any glaring errors!
- The file interceptor script is also still in development.
## Bash Scripts
- revshell.sh is a helpful script I use to output reverse shell one-liners with my attacking ip and port. These one-liners were taken from:
